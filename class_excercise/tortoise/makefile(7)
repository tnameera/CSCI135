#
# This is an example Makefile for FuelTank project.  This
# Typing 'make' or 'make run' will create the executable file.
#

# define some Makefile variables for the compiler and compiler flags
# to use Makefile variables later in the Makefile: $()
#
#  -g    adds debugging information to the executable file
#  -Wall turns on most, but not all, compiler warnings
#
# for C++ define  CC = g++
CC = g++
#CFLAGS  = -g -Wall

# typing 'make' will invoke the first target entry in the file 
# (in this case the default target entry)
# you can name this target entry anything, but "default" or "all"
# are the most commonly used names by convention
#
all: run

# To create the executable file run we need the object files
run:  FuelTankClient.o FuelTank.o 
	$(CC) -o fuel_tank FuelTankClient.o FuelTank.o

# To create the object file FuelTankClient.o, 
# we need source FuelTankClient.cpp 
FuelTankClient.o:  FuelTankClient.cpp
	$(CC) -c FuelTankClient.cpp

# To create the object file FuelTank.o, we need source
# files FuelTank.cpp
#
FuelTank.o:  FuelTank.cpp
	$(CC) -c FuelTank.cpp

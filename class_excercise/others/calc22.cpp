Write a better version of the calculator, calc2.cpp, that can evaluate multiple arithmetic expressions. Letâ€™s use the semicolon symbol that must be used at the end of each expression in the input.

Assuming that the input file formulas.txt looks as follows:

15 ;
10 + 3 + 0 + 25 ;
5 + 6 - 7 - 8 + 9 + 10 - 11 ;
When we run the program with that input, the output should evaluate all of the expressions and print them each on its own line:

$ ./calc2 < formulas.txt
15 
38
4
*/

// give a bunch of formulas , ended by
//calculate and  print the sum
// 3+5 =6;
//-6 -7 + 8;
//10+2 -3 +6;
//chalenging
// we get a; to process

// set pre-operator for the first number to be "+' save in ch;
// set the sum to 0;
// declare num as an int, which saves the values of the current incoming nb
// as long there is num // while ( cin >> num);
// begin
//   (1) based on ch, the pre -operator for the current number //if (ch == '+')
//    adjust sum // sum+=num
//   (2) prepare for the operator for the next integer, we might need to skip unknown number of spaces 
//to get that sum.//cin >> ch
// we might need to skip unknown number of spaces to get that sum
//   (3)now ch maybe +, - or ;
//if + or - we cannot do anything now reason: + or - is pre-operator before next number
//we need to incorporate + or  - with next number  in (1)
//but ch mgith be ; after the current number say 3;//end of the current formula
//if (ch == ';')
//print sum
//sum = 0 // reset sum for the next formula
//what is the operator for the first number for the next formula

//how to adjust the abobe code to a handle multiple formulas?
//that is what to do with semicolon? that ends a formula



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{          
    int sum = 0;
    int num;
    char op = '+';

    while ( cin >> num){
        
        //cout << num << endl;
        if (op == '-')
           { 
               sum -= num; // for negative op
           }
        else
           { 
               sum += num; // every other case should be positive
           }
      
        cin >> op;
        
        if (op == ';'){
            cout << sum << endl; // print sum
            sum = 0; //sum = 0 // reset sum for the next formula
        }
        }
    
    return 0;
}

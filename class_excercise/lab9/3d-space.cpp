Assignment: TaskE,lab9
Task A program 3d-space.cpp, in which you define a function length() 
that receives the coordinates of a point P passed as a pointer, and computes the distance from the origin to the point P:

Task B In the same file 3d-space.cpp, add a functioN
Which receives the coordinates of two points (passed as pointers), and returns the pointer of the point
// that is farther away from the origin.

Task C
Letâ€™s consider an object moving in 3D space. We already know how to describe its position. 
//(We will be assuming metric system, thus distances will be implicitly measured in meters and time in seconds.)

Task E
In the program 3d-space.cpp, add functions that create, delete, and coordinate objects dynamically:

//Task A

double length(Coord3D* p){
    // get the values from Coord3D object that p points(x,y,z)
    // p is the memory address, at the address is a Coord3D object
    
    // Coord3D point = *p;
    // to get the values derefence the pointer
    // p is equal to the object at the momory address p
    //cout << point.x << endl;// data members of objects since we have dereferenced it

    double x = p->x; // double x = (*p).x, deference + dot notation
    double y = p->y; // double x = (*p).y;arrow refers I want to derefence p, ie get the actual value of p ans also use access object data member
